        The harmonic analysis method consists in expressing the ocean tidal
        variations as a sum of independent constituents accordingly to the
        tidal potential spectrum. Then the sea surface elevation at a point
        :math:`(x, y)` and time :math:`t` can be expressed as a linear sum as
        follow:

        .. math::

            S_{ap} = S_{0}(x, y) + \\sum_{k=0}^n f_{k}(t)S_{k}(x, y)
            \\times cos [\\omega_{k}t + {v}_{k}(t) + u_{k}(t) - G_{k}(x,y)]

        where:

            * :math:`n` is the number of constituents,
            * :math:`S_{0}(x, y)` is the mean sea level,
            * :math:`S_{k}(x, y)` is the amplitude of the constituent of index
              :math:`k`,
            * :math:`G_{k}(x, y)` is the phase lag relative to Greenwich time,
            * :math:`w_{k}` is the angular frequency of the constituent of
              index :math:`k`,
            * :math:`v_{k}` is the astronomical argument at time :math:`t`,
            * :math:`f_{k}(t)` is the nodal correction coefficient applied to
              the amplitude of the constituent of index :math:`k`,
            * :math:`u_{k}(t)` is the nodal correction coefficient applied to
              the phase of the constituent of index :math:`k`.

        The a priori analysis spectrum includes the most important astronomical
        constituents in the Darwin development, completed by Shureman in 1958,
        and many non-linear waves. The definition of tidal constants and
        astronomical arguments is taken from FES2014 tidal prediction software
        and a complete definition of waves is also available in Shureman
        (1958). This spectrum is the most commonly used for harmonic analysis
        due the simplification given by the nodal correction concept (:math:`f`
        and :math:`u` coefficients above) which allows dealing with slow
        motions of the lunar ascending node and reducing the number of
        constituents in the tidal spectrum.

        More details about this harmonic analysis method can be found in
        Ponchaut et al. 1999.
