About this project
==================

*pytide* allows to analyze the tidal constituents of a time series from a
:meth:`harmonic analysis <pytide.WaveTable.harmonic_analysis>`. The definition
of tidal constants and astronomical arguments is taken from `FES2014 tidal
prediction software <https://bitbucket.org/cnes_aviso/fes/src/master/>`_.

It was developed to analyze the *MIT/GCM LLC4320* model. The script used to
perform this analysis is distributed with this distribution.
